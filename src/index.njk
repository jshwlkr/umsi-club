    <h2>What's this?</h2>
    <p>
        A community of sites around a common topic, also known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring">webring</a>. 
        Each member includes a badge on their site that links to the previous and next sites in the ring.
    </p>

    <h2>How to join</h2>
    <p>
        To join the webring, <a href="{{ meta.repo }}/compare">open a pull request</a> 
        and supply the name and URL of your site. If you publish a RSS feed, you can provide that as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you don't have a Github account, you can also use this form to sign up. 
        The webring admins will then look at your site and handle your request.
    </p>

    {% include 'signupform.njk' %}

    <h2>Add the banner</h2>
    <p>
        Once you've joined the ring, if you like, copy this code snippet into your site:
    </p>

    {% highlight 'html' %}{% include 'snippet.njk' %}{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        It will render this banner that links to the other members:
    </p>

    {% include 'snippet.njk' %}
